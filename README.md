# ETL-SE
 Let’s imagine you’re a user interested in the influence of technology blogs on the latest web development trends. Here’s how you might interact with the app:
	1. Data Extraction: You start by entering keywords related to web development into the app’s search interface. The app uses SERPAPI to scrape search engine results for these keywords, gathering data on technology blogs that frequently discuss web development topics.
	
	
	2. Network Construction: The app processes the scraped data and uses NetworkX to construct a network graph. In this graph, each node represents a technology blog, and edges represent the frequency with which two blogs mention the same web development topics.


	1. Network Analysis: You’re curious about which blogs are central to the discussion. The app calculates centrality measures and identifies key blogs that act as hubs in the network. It also uses community detection algorithms to reveal clusters of blogs that often reference each other.



	1. Heatmap Visualization: To understand the strength of these relationships, you navigate to the heatmap visualization. The app displays a color-coded matrix where each cell represents the connection strength between two blogs, with warmer colors indicating stronger connections.



	1. 3D Mesh Modeling: For a more immersive experience, you switch to the 3D mesh model view. The app presents a three-dimensional network graph where you can rotate and zoom in on different parts of the network. Node size and color vary according to the blog’s centrality and cluster membership.



User Interface Interaction: Throughout your exploration, the app’s UI allows you to filter results, adjust visualization parameters, and even click on individual nodes to read summaries of the blog’s content or see its position within the overall network.![image](https://github.com/AhmedHamdyKotp/ETL-SE/assets/160382377/ea262588-7f3c-4c8b-9c1b-8b97aaa7bbd6)
