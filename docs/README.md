# Analyzing Online Social Networks through Search Engine Data


## Project Overview
  *This project aims to analyze and visualize online social networks using publicly available data from search engine results. By leveraging web scraping techniques and the SERPAPI (Search Engine Results Page API), we gather information about relationships between           websites and topics of interest. The collected data is used to construct a network graph using NetworkX and visualize network properties using heatmaps and 3D mesh models.

## Project Components

### 1. Web Scraping with SERPAPI  ---> DONE !!
  *We implement web scraping to extract data from search engine results pages (SERPs) using the SERPAPI.

### 2. Network Construction with NetworkX ---> DONE !!
We utilize NetworkX, a Python library for network analysis, to build a graph representing the relationships between websites and topics. Websites are represented as nodes and relationships (e.g., co-occurrence in search results) as edges.

### 3. Network Analysis ---> DONE !!
We perform basic network analysis to identify key nodes (websites/topics) based on centrality measures (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality). We also explore community detection algorithms to uncover clusters of related websites/topics.

### 4. Heatmap Visualization ---> DONE !!
We use heatmap visualization techniques to depict the strength of relationships (edges) between nodes (websites/topics). The heatmap is color-coded based on edge weights or other network metrics to highlight important connections.

### 5. 3D Mesh Modeling ---> DONE !!
We implement 3D mesh modeling to visualize the network graph in a three-dimensional space. Attributes (e.g., node size, color) are assigned based on network properties to create an interactive and visually engaging representation.

### 6. User Interface (UI) ---> DONE !!
The project includes a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the network graph and visualization tools.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to install some dependencies. Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for a list of required packages.
